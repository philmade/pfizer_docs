This is my attempt at verifying JikkyLeaks count of patients in the Pfizer trial who were N-antibody NEGATIVE at Week_1, then POSITIVE at Week_3. The data is in CSV format.

To make this work you'll need poetry and PANDAS.
With poetry, just type 'poetry shell' then 'poetry install'
You'll need to be able to push VSCODE to use poetry python environments

Alternatively, if you don't have poetry you can make it work with PIP as PANDAS is the only dependency. Just create an environment, install pandas, and run Jupyter from inside VSCODE with that environment.

Code is in the .ipynb notebook.

YOU NEED THE CSV FOR THIS TO WORK.

Github won't let me upload the CSV, download it directly from JikkyLeaks source then add it to your environment root:
